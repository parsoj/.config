#+TITLE: OSX config files

* Bootstrapping
- I try to keep track of my important Brew installs through my Brewfile, so that
  I can bootstrap a new system quickly if I need to.
* Window Mangement
- I use [[https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm][chunkwm]] for window management/tiling.
* Hotkeys
- all my keyboard shortcuts are managed my [[https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd][skhd]] - a hotkey daemon for mac
- most of my hotkeys are bound either to calls to chunkwm's chunkc for window management,
  or to bash or apple scripts (located in the /scripts directory) that automate
  common desktop actions
* Menu Bar
- I use Bartenter to organize and hide menu bar items
** in the menu bar
- iStat-Menus for pretty system health graphs
- [[https://github.com/matryer/bitbar][bitbar]] & some bash scripts for any random information that I want to display in the menu-bar
