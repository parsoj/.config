My personal laptop configurations.


** Bash
- there is not much in my bash config, since I mostly live out of Emacs. the
  fancy biz is over there :)
** Git
- just global git configurations
** OSX
- tools and configurations for managing desktop automation and package
  management.
- I tend to prefer code-only configuration tools, since they are simpler and everything can be
  checked into source control and easily be ported to other machines

** Emacs
Currently living out of [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] - will look into setting up a full Emacs
"Literate Configuration" one day....
