#+TITLE: Notes on Org Mode System

* Properties to attach to tasks
  - Cost (monetary)
  - EffORT
  - BLOCKERS
  - TRIGGERS

    

* Use Cases
  
** deps
*** block this task on another task (completing read for the other task)
*** block another task on this task (completing read)
   
    
** agenda
*** next up
**** Filter out
***** blocked tasks
***** tasks which you are unable to work on based on context
***** 
**** other concerns
     - priority/due-date
       - we want to not spend too much time on lower priority items
**** want to make sure higher-priority items are moving forward consistently
**** want to not spend too much time on lower priority items ( but don't hide them completely - they are still actionable)

   
*** Thoughts
    - should we limit lower-pri projects to only showing a certain number a day? 
    - should all projects have display limits? 
    - should there be an overall display limit?
      
    - should we "weight" or "value" different tasks or projects, and show only the highest-priority stuff? 
      
**** what should go into deciding the ranking of something?
     - there is a big wait period comming up 
       - get the "waiting" started sooner, so can focus on other things while that is moving on its own
***** eisenhower matrix
     - urgency (due date)
     - importance (alignment with your values)
*****  value vs cost matrix
      - similar to eisenhower matrix -
	
***** ICE Scoring
      
***** RICE Scoring
      
***** weighted scoring
      assign value and/or cost scores to criteria
      each criteria has a weight that is used to add up to a total score
      - basically a Perceptron or single-layer network


** Estimation Items
*** get total cost to complete project/task
    - (add up cost for all subtasks)

*** get total effort cost for project/task

*** get estimated time to completion (assuming tasks are completed as soon as available
