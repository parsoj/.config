#+TITLE: Dev Notes on Dependencies


* Investigation Items
** find out how to check availability of upstream blockers/deps

* Tasks
** build "unblock downstreams" functions
*** actual edna action func
    - just for-loop over args and call unblock func
*** set-blocked func
    - check if all upstream blockers are done
      - if so, mark task as available
      - else, mark task as unavailable/blocked

* Notes
** Block this task on another
 
** Block another task on this
  
** Mark Task as Complete

*** Check if we can complete it
    - check if any blockers are active
    - org edna should handle this automatically with the BLOCKER property

*** Unblock tasks blocked on this one
**** when completing a task - we need to remove it as a dep from downstream tasks  
     - remove id from blocker list
     - if blocker list is now empty, update TODO state 
***** Answer:
      From "extending org edna", "Actions" section:
      https://www.nongnu.org/org-edna-el/#org369b38e
    
      you can define your own custom actions, finders, and conditions
      
**** steps
    1. remove own ID from blocker list
    2. check if blocker list is now empty
       - if so - change state to available
