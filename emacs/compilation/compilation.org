#+TITLE: Compiling Emacs from Source

* Steps
** Install Xcode
** Install xcode command-line tools
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   xcode-select --install
   #+END_SRC
*** you might need to nuke the existing solution if this isn't working:
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
    #+END_SRC
** Install macOS sdk headers
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg
    #+END_SRC

** note: might need to adjust CPATH to point to mac sdks (catalina no longer uses usr/local)
** fix texinfo/makeinfo stuff
 brew install texinfo
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/texinfo/bin:$PATH"

** Install libxml2
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   brew install libxml2
   export LIBXML2_CFLAGS=`xml2-config --cflags`
   export LIBXML2_LIBS=`xml2-config --libs`
   #+END_SRC
   
** Install gnutls
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   brew install gnutls
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/gnutls/3.6.10/bin/
   #+END_SRC
*** NOTE: homebrew may claim that gnutls was successfully installed when it wasn't
    - if you run into an issue where `./configure` can't find gnutls, check that gnutls has all of its dependencies met:
      #+BEGIN_SRC
      brew info gnutls
      #+END_SRC
     and then manually install those dependencies, before reinstalling gnutls
   
** Set environment variables
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib/pkgconfig"
   #+END_SRC

** Run the Compilation (Run from the root dir of the cloned emacs repo:
*** Autogen
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   ./autogen.sh
   #+END_SRC
*** Configure
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   ./configure
   #+END_SRC
*** Make & Install
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   make && make install
   #+END_SRC
   

*** also:
needed to run "mkdir -p /usr/local/libexec/emacs"
** Copy the compiled app to your `/Applications` folder
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   cp -r nextstep/Emacs.app /Applications/
   #+END_SRC
